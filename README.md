👨🏽‍💻 I’m an MBA candidate and global business specialist transitioning into cybersecurity.  
I'm currently completing the **Google Cybersecurity Certificate**, driven by a passion for protecting people and systems—and the desire to bring technical protection to real-world communities, especially where access is limited.

🌍 My background spans international business, multilingual communication, and enrollment coordination at Madison College and Apple. I’ve worked with people from all over the world, helping them reach their goals, and now I want to help secure their futures.

🛠️ I’m currently working on:
- Internal audit simulations using NIST CSF
- Threat intelligence and incident response projects
- Building a cybersecurity portfolio with hands-on labs

💡 Why cybersecurity?  
Because it's a meaningful, fast-growing field where I can blend my analytical skills, global perspective, and passion for impact. Yes, the financial stability is appealing—but more importantly, this path allows me to contribute to safety, privacy, and equity in the digital age.

🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on:
- Blue team and security operations projects
- Entry-level SOC, compliance, or education-focused security initiatives
- Language-localized cybersecurity awareness projects
